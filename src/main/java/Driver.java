	 * Generally, "Driver" classes are responsible for setting up and calling other
	 * classes, usually from a main() method that parses command-line parameters.
	 * Generalized reusable code are usually placed outside of the Driver class.
	 * They are sometimes called "Main" classes too, since they usually include the
	 * main() method.
	 *
	 * If the driver were only responsible for a single class, we use that class
	 * name. For example, "TaxiDriver" is what we would name a driver class that
	 * just sets up and calls the "Taxi" class.
	 *
	 * The starter code (calculating elapsed time) is not necessary. It can be
	 * removed from the main method.
